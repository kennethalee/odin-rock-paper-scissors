# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is a simple console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game developed in JavaScript. It was created as part of my journey to strengthen my programming skills and understanding of fundamental game mechanics.

## Features

- **Human vs. Computer Gameplay**: Test your skills against a computer opponent.
- **Randomized Computer Choices**: Ensures fair gameplay by using random selection for the computer's moves.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of scores for both the player and the computer across multiple rounds.
- **Interactive Console-Based Interface**: Provides feedback and results directly in the console.

## Tools

- **JavaScript**: For building the game logic and structure.

## Objective

Create a game that:

- Reinforces fundamental programming concepts.
- Helps practice user input handling and conditional logic.

## Insights

- Gained experience with JavaScript syntax and functions.
- Improved understanding of loops and conditionals for implementing game mechanics.
- Debugged and tested the game logic to ensure a smooth and fair user experience.

## Future Plans

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced interactivity.
- Introduce multiplayer functionality.
- Implement an option for unlimited rounds or user-defined game length.
- Enhance the computer opponent with adaptive AI.

## Personal Thoughts

Structuring the game logic was initially challenging, especially ensuring fair and valid inputs from the user. However, as I progressed, it became a rewarding process to see the game come together and function as intended.

Overall, this project was a fun and educational experience, and I look forward to adding more features.
